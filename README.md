# Server Side Calculator


## Description

Duration: ~5-6 hrs over 3 days;


In this project, I created a calculator that intakes numbers and operators from the browser and processes the calculations on the server. Once these calculations have been completed they get sent back to the browser to be displayed as a solution and also as a part of the calculation history. There are also buttons to clear the inputs and to clear the calculation history. Requirements were also implemented that cause you to have to fill out both inputs with numbers and select an operator to calculate a solution. Upon filling out and clicking all required fields you must click the "=" button to display your solution.

Prerequisites:

* [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/download/)
* [jQuery] (https://jquery.com/download/)
* Express

Installation: 

1. Fork and Clone files from gitHub and copy the link to download onto your computer.
2. Once downloaded and all required software has been downloaded, open up your editor of choice.
3. In a new terminal window type 'npm init -y' then 'npm install express' into your terminal.
4. From this point you should be able to input 'npm start'.
5. Type in 'localhost:8000' into your browser url address bar and the Server Side Calculator should appear.

Usage:
1. Enter a number into input field 1 & 2.
2. Select your operator of choice that will either add, subtract, multiply, or divide the numbers.
3. After completing steps 1 & 2, press the '=' button to complete the calculation.
4. To see the result of your calculation look next to the area with the 'Solution:' headline.
5. If you would like to start a new calculation, press the 'clear' button to clear out the input fields.
6. To see previous calculations that you have made, look below the calculation history heading.
7. Lastly, if you would like to delete your calculation history, press the 'delete history' button.

Built With:
* Node.js
* jQuery
* Express
